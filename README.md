# Sass: CSS with superpowers

## Practical work using Sass to update the style of old repositories

---

After a few well-spent hours of personal studies to know better this CSS extention language, I decided to give it a go and apply what I have seen so far into old repositories. 

This is so far, the best way to apply style into webpages. It is a way more organized, clean, easy to understand and less lines of code for a project.
